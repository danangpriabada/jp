# Kanji-Uchiwake

![alt text](https://github.com/uchiwakekanji/jp/tree/main/html/local-resources/images/capture-app.jpg)

This Javascript app displays a kanji character's "exploded view" -- all components subdivided -- with associations to related kanji sharing those components.

The JSON file is adapted from kanjidic2.xml, available from http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project (Old Page : http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjd2index.html).
